# print-archive-helper
This is an add-on to the main UCLA Print Archive project. Much of UCLA's news history is stored in large microfilm reels,
where the only way to accurately get the date for each page is to insert it into the database manually. The goal of this
helper site is to allow as many people as possible to contribute to the manual insertion of dates. 

GOALS:
The site will display a pdf page, the user will input the date he/she sees on the page, submit it, and it will be added to the database in real time. The site will keep showing images until the user clicks "I'm done!", or something along those lines.
